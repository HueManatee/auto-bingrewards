# auto-bingrewards
Code that will allow you to max out your Microsoft Rewards for the day (if you are level 2).

There is definitely a better, more efficient way to do this. I think they make simple browser extentions that do this for you...but I made it so there.

You need to install Python for both files to run properly...you know how to do that.

For Option 1: You need to install the Python Modules: mouse, keyboard, time and random if you haven't already installed them.  

For Option 2: You need to install the Python Modules: keyboard, time and random if you haven't already installed them.

You can do this by running

pip3 install keyboard

And so on...in Terminal or Command Prompt...you know.

Have fun with my weird code!
